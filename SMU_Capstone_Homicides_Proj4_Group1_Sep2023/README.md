# Homicides Over the Past Decade

**Project Overview:**

- **Project Title:** Homicides over the past decade
- **Project Purpose:** This project serves as an exploration of a standard homicide dataset using a variety of tools and techniques, including machine learning and Tableau.
- **Project Objectives:** 
  - Connect to a dataset and organize it into usable data frames.
  - Perform supervised modeling and predictions.
  - Utilize correlation analysis.
  - Create a range of visualizations including Bar, Donut, and Line charts using Tableau.
  
**Data Collection:**

The dataset used in this project was sourced from The Washington Post, encompassing data on over 52,000 criminal homicides that occurred over the past decade in 50 of the largest American cities. The dataset includes information about the location of the homicide, whether an arrest was made, and, in most cases, basic demographic details about each victim. Reporters dedicated months to cleaning and standardizing this data, cross-referencing homicide counts and aggregate closure rates with FBI data to ensure its accuracy.

**Why We Chose This Topic:**

- **Carlos:** My inspiration for this project was to analyze a homicide dataset, specifically investigating how victim age influences arrest outcomes in cases.
- **Raj:** I wanted to learn more about homicide datasets and related investigations. This project allowed me to apply the knowledge acquired during the data science bootcamp to perform data analysis and potentially contribute to volunteer programs aimed at improving community safety.
- **Ann:** I have a genuine interest in understanding the shared factors among all homicide cases and uncovering patterns within them.
- **John:** Homicides are always a tragic occurrence, and I believed that gaining a better understanding of which populations are most affected would help us address this issue more effectively and protect those demographics.
