This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 22 Challenge.
All code was resourced from the SMU Boot Camp Class.

CODE IS RUN USING GOOGLE COLABORATORY

Files:
1.	Rename the Home_Sales_starter_code.ipynb file as Home_Sales.ipynb.

SMU Boot Camp Stater Code used for:
"https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv"

Programs used:
SparksSQL
Google Colaboratory
GitHub 

Challenge â€“ To use, SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and un-cache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been un-cached.

After using the starter code and a setting up a temporary table, I have answered 3 questions using SQL queries. 
- Uncache the home_sales temporary table.
- Verify that the home_sales temporary table is uncached using PySpark.
- Download your Home_Sales.ipynb file and upload it into your "Home_Sales" GitHub repository.

The cached had the fastest completion time.
