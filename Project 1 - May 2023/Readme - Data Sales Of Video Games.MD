Project Goal: Identify what makes profitable games.

Project Questions:
1. Are there any regions that help dictate successful game sales?
2. Does genre have any impact on sales?
3. Do certain publishers do better in video game sales?
4. Are there any differences in gaming platforms sales?

Analysis Summary:
Data cleaning - cleaned headers, added Platform Company and Decade Columns, drop null years and post 2015 years. 
Used categorical graphs to identify leading platforms and genres by overall, decade and platform company.
Used correlations and regressions to analyze the relationship between North American sales vs other regions.
Calculated outliers by genre for 2010s. 

Analysis Results:
Question Answers
1. North American Region has the highest correlation with Global Sales.
2. Based on a 5-Number Summary, genres alone do not impact sales. Specific titles in genres, such as series or franchise do.
3. Higher sales by publisher depend on types of platofrms used and longevity of series and franchises. Nintendo (Pokemon), Activision (Call of Duty), Microsoft (Halo)
4. Nintendo and Sony, with larger quantities of platforms over time have larger video game sales over all. Nintendo bought Sega turning it into an in house publisher.

Extra Analysis:
Sales of games bundled with consoles or hardware outperform single game sales.
Long running franchises and series have a built up following and maintain repeat buyers with sustained high value sales.
New unique games with special novelties also are a good way to break into the market.
Genre comparisons show that shooters have a higher probability of success compared to other genres in North America.
Role-Playing games are successful in most regions.

Predictions:
A game needs to be successful in North America to be successful globally.
The novelty of an RPG/Shooter that is on multiple platforms has a high chance of success.
