## Module 10 Challenge
## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data - In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

## Background
# Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a Hawaii climate database that contains precipitation and temperature observations across 9 stations. Once the analysis is complete, design a Flask API based on SQLAlchemy ORM queries.

## Technologies Used
# Python
# SQLAlchemy
# Pandas
# Matplotlib

## Objectives
# Data analysis and exploration
# Flask API design
# Data Analysis and Exploration

## First, set up base, create classes for each table, and connect to the sqlite database.
# set up Base


## Part 2: Design Your Climate App - after completion of the initial analysis, now to design a Flask API based on the developed queries and routes
# Join the station and measurement tables for some of the queries.
# Use the Flask jsonify function to convert API data to a valid JSON response object.
